# Introduction

In this lab you'll review and get practice with a variety of concepts, methods, and tools you've encountered thus far.

# Part 1 - All about Quarto

## Exercise 1

a.  For each of the character strings below, determine if the string is a proper code chunk label.
    If not, explain why and how you would fix it.

    -   Chunk 1:

    ```         
    #| label: a-label 
    #| with-a-line-break
    ```

    -   Chunk 2:

    ```         
    #| label: areaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllllyyyyylooooooooooooooooooonglabel 
    ```

    -   Chunk 3:

    ```         
    #| label: label with spaces
    ```

    -   Chunk 4:

    ```         
    #| label: label-with-dashes
    ```

    ::: callout-tip
    Try each label option in the code chunk provided in your document.
    If it gives you an error (document doesn't render), you know it's not a proper chunk label.
    :::

b.  Which of the chunk label options above is the best option?
    Explain your reasoning in 1-2 sentences.

## Exercise 2

You have the following code chunk:

```{r}
#| eval: false
    
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Add the following code chunk options, one at a time, and set each to `false` and then to `true`.
After each value, render your document and observe its effect.
Ultimately, choose the values that are the most appropriate for this code chunk.
Based on the behaviors you observe, describe what each code chunk option does.

-   `echo`
-   `warning`
-   `eval`

## Exercise 3

a.  You have the following code chunk again.

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false

    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
      geom_point()
    ```

    Add `fig-width` and `fig-asp` as code chunk options.
    Try setting `fig-width` to values between 1 and 10.
    Try setting `fig-asp` to values between 0.1 and 1.
    Re-render the document after each value and observe its effect.
    Ultimately, choose values that make the plot look visually pleasing in the rendered document.
    Based on the behavior you observe, describe what each chunk option does.

b.  You have the following code chunk again.

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false

    gplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
      geom_point()
    ```

    Add `error` as a code chunk option and set it to `false` and then set it to `true`.
    After each value, render your document and observe its effect.
    Ultimately, choose the value that allows you to render your document without altering the code.
    Based on the behavior you observe, describe what this code chunk option does.

# Part 2 - Misrepresentation

## Exercise 4

The following chart was [shared](https://twitter.com/GraphCrimes/status/1566264004288331776) by \@GraphCrimes on Twitter on September 3, 2022.

![](images/private-sector.jpg){fig-align="center"}

a.  What is misleading about this graph?
b.  Suppose you wanted to recreate this plot, with improvements to avoid its misleading pitfalls from part (a). You would obviously need the data from the survey in order to be able to do that. How many observations would this data have? How many variables (at least) should it have, and what should those variables be?

## Exercise 5

a.  Load the data for this survey from `data/survation.csv`. Confirm that the data match the percentages from the visualization. That is, calculate the percentages of public sector, private sector, don't know for each of the services and check that they match the percentages from the plot.
b.  Recreate the visualization, and improve it. You only need to submit the improved version, not a recreation of the misleading graph exactly. Does the improved visualization look different than the original? Does it send a different message at a first glance?

# Part 3 - DatasauRus

The data frame you will be working with in this part is called `datasaurus_dozen` and it's in the **datasauRus** package.
This single data frame contains 13 datasets, designed to show us why data visualization is important and how summary statistics alone can be misleading.
The different datasets are marked by the `dataset` variable.

::: callout-note
If it's confusing that the data frame is called `datasaurus_dozen` when it contains 13 datasets, you're not alone!
Have you heard of a [baker's dozen](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/32259/why-bakers-dozen-13)?
:::

Here is a peek at the top 10 rows of the dataset:

```{r}
datasaurus_dozen
```

## Exercise 6

Calculate the mean of `x`, mean of `y`, standard deviation of `x`, standard deviation of `y`, and the correlation between `x` and `y` for each level of the `dataset` variable.
How do these summary statistics compare across groups (datasets)?

## Exercise 7

Create a scatterplot of `y` versus `x` and color and facet it by `dataset`.
How do these plots compare across groups (datasets)?
How does your response in this question compare to your response to the previous question.

# Part 4 - Election polling

SurveyUSA polled 1,500 US adults between January 31, 2024 and February 2, 2024.
Of the 1,500 adults, 1,259 were identified by SurveyUSA as being registered to vote, and of these 1,048 were found to be likely to vote in the 2024 November election for President.[^1]
The following question was asked to these 1,048 adults:

[^1]: Full survey results can be found at <https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=300d50f5-303b-4652-b59e-6fbf1b87e24a>.

> 1,048 were found to be likely to vote in the 2024 November election for President and were asked the substantive questions which follow.

Responses were broken down into the following categories:

| Variable | Levels                                     |
|:---------|:-------------------------------------------|
| Age      | 18-49; 50+                                 |
| Vote     | Donald Trump (R); Joe Biden (D); Undecided |

Of the 1,048 responses, 507 were between the ages of 18-49.
Of the individuals that are between 18-49, 238 individuals responded that they would vote for Donald Trump, 237 said they would vote for Joe Biden, and the remainder were undecided.
Of the individuals that are 50+, 271 individuals responded that they would vote for Donald Trump, 228 said they would vote for Joe Biden, and the remainder were undecided.

## Exercise 8

a.  Fill in the code below to create a two-way table that summarizes these data.

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false

    survey_counts <- tibble( 
      age = c(),
      vote = c(),
      values = ()
      )

    survey_counts |>
      pivot_wider( 
        names_from = ...,
        values_from = ...
      )
    ```

b.  Using your table from part (a), calculate the proportion of individuals in this sample who are 50+ and planning to vote for Donald Trump.

c.  Using your table from part (a), calculate the proportion of individuals in this sample who are 18-49 and planning to vote for Donald Trump.

## Exercise 9

a.  Create an appropriate visualization to for the relationship between `age` and `vote`.
    Your plot should include appropriate labels.
    *Hint:* You may have to re-manipulate the data into a more usable form.

b.  Based on your calculations so far as well as your visualization, write 1-3 sentences that describe the relationship, in this sample, between age and plans for presidential vote.

# Part 5 - Ethics

## Exercise 10

To complete this exercise you will first need to watch the documentary Coded Bias.
To do so, you either need to be on the Duke network or connected to the Duke VPN. Then go to <https://find.library.duke.edu/catalog/DUKE009834953> and click on "View Online".
Once you watch the video, write a reflection in 2-5 bullet points highlighting at least one thing that you already knew about (from the course prep materials) and at least one thing you learned from the movie as well as any other aspects of the documentary that you found interesting / enlightening.

::: callout-important
This question requires no code, only narrative.
Remember that, based on the [syllabus](https://sta199-s24.github.io/course-syllabus.html#academic-honesty), you may not use generative AI tools (e.g., Chat GPT) to write narrative on assignments.
