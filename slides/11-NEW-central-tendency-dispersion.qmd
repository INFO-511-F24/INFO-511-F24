## Project grading

-   Outlined at <https://sta199-s24.github.io/project/description.html#grading>.

-   Each milestone has points associated with it.

-   Additionally there are points allocated to reproducibility and organization as well as teamwork (to be measured by within team peer evaluations three times throughout the semester).

-   Most important thing you can do today for your project: Block off agreed times in your calendar!
