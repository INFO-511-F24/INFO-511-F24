## Project presentations due Dec 10! ðŸ¥³ {.smaller}

-   Make sure your presentation is pushed to your GitHub repo before your lab section.

-   **All team members must take part in the presentation**

-   Deliver or play your 5-minute presentation -- you'll lose 1 point/ minute over 5.

-   Fill out feedback forms while you listen to others' presentations.

## Project write-ups due Dec 08

-   There's a good chance you'll be done with these on Monday as well

-   But you might want to improve your write-up based on inspiration from other teams' presentations and/or ideas that came up during your peer-reviews.

-   Project repos will close at 5:00pm on Wednesday, Dec 08.
    Make sure to push your final edits to GitHub.

## Expectations {.smaller}

> The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.

::: callout-note
Beyond, if you like -- "you" is the whole team!

## Expectations {.smaller}

> The goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis i.e., do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable, but rather let me know that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis, that you are proficient in using Python, and that you are proficient at interpreting and presenting the results.

## Requirements

> Focus on methods that help you begin to answer your research questions.
> You do not have to apply every statistical procedure we learned.

## Tip {.smaller}

> Critique your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis.
> Discuss issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and appropriateness of the statistical analysis.

::: callout-tip
You can critique the current research without talking about a hypothetical future research,.

## How many plots {.smaller}

> You do not need to visualize all of the data at once.
> A single high-quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor-quality visualizations.

::: callout-note
There is no specific, secret number of visualizations I'm expecting, the right number is the number that it takes to answer your question.

## Submission {.smaller}

> Submission of these deliverables will happen on GitHub and feedback will be provided as GitHub issues that you need to engage with and close.
> The collection of the documents in your GitHub repo will create a webpage for your project.
> To create the webpage go to VS Code, open a terminal and type `quarto publish gh-pages` or if you have published via Quarto Pubs \`quarto publish quarto-pub
