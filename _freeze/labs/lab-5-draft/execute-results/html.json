What values does each of the following chunk options take and what do they do?\n\n    -   `eval`\n\n    -   `error`\n\n    -   `warning`\n\n    -   `echo`\n\n    To answer this question I recommend adding each of the chunk options, one at a time, and re-rendering the document with some sample code in the chunk.\n\nb.  What do the chunk options `fig-height` and `fig-width` do -- what do they do when they're set in a single code chunk and what do they do when they're set in the document YAML on top?\n\n    To answer this question I recommend creating two code chunks with the same plotting code in them, re-rendering the document with different values for these chunk options in the chunk YAML and then different values in the document YAML.\n\n# Part 2 - Misrepresentation\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nThe following chart was [shared](https://twitter.com/GraphCrimes/status/1566264004288331776) by \\@GraphCrimes on Twitter on September 3, 2022.\n\n![](images/private-sector.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\na.  What is misleading about this graph?\nb.  Suppose you wanted to recreate this plot, with improvements to avoid its misleading pitfalls from part (a). You would obviously need the data from the survey in order to be able to do that. How many observations would this data have? How many variables (at least) should it have, and what should those variables be?\nc.  Load the data for this survey from `data/survation.csv`. Confirm that the data match the percentages from the visualization. That is, calculate the percentages of public sector, private sector, don't know for each of the services and check that they match the percentages from the plot.\nd.  Recreate the visualization, and improve it. You only need to submit the improved version, not a recreation of the misleading graph exactly. Does the improved visualization look different than the original? Does it send a different message at a first glance?\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nOne more on this\n\n# Part 3 - Datasaurus\n\nFrom <https://sta199-f22-1.github.io/labs/lab-0.html#exercises>.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nDatasaurus dozen – why is it important to visualize first?\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nDatasaurus dozen – why is it important to visualize first?\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nDatasaurus dozen – why is it important to visualize first?\n\n# Part 4 - ...\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nSomething else...\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nSurveyUSA polled 1,500 US adults between January 31, 2024 and February 2, 2024.\nOf the 1,500 adults, 1,259 were identified by SurveyUSA as being registered to vote, and of these 1,048 were found to be likely to vote in the 2024 November election for President.[^1]\nThe following question was asked to these 1,048 adults:\n\n[^1]: Full survey results can be found at <https://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=300d50f5-303b-4652-b59e-6fbf1b87e24a>.\n\n> 1,048 were found to be likely to vote in the 2024 November election for President and were asked the substantive questions which follow.\n\nResponses were broken down into the following categories:\n\n| Variable | Levels                                     |\n|:---------|:-------------------------------------------|\n| Age      | 18-49; 50+                                 |\n| Vote     | Donald Trump (R); Joe Biden (D); Undecided |\n\na.  Of the 1,048 responses, 507 were between the ages of 18-49. Of the individuals that are between 18-49, 238 individuals responded that they would vote for Donald Trump, 237 said they would vote for Joe Biden, and the remainder were undecided. Of the individuals that are 50+, 271 individuals responded that they would vote for Donald Trump, 228 said they would vote for Joe Biden, and the remainder were undecided. Fill in the code below to create a two-way table that summarizes these data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsurvey_counts <- tibble( \n  age = c(),\n  vote = c(),\n  values = ()\n  )\n\nsurvey_counts |>\n  pivot_wider( \n    names_from = ...,\n    values_from = ...\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nb.  Using your table from part (a), calculate the proportion of individuals in this sample who are 50+ and planning to vote for Donald Trump.\n\nc.  Using your table from part (a), calculate the proportion of individuals in this sample who are 18-49 and planning to vote for Donald Trump.\n\nd.  Create an appropriate visualization to compare the the relationship between `age` and `vote`.\n    Your plot should include appropriate labels.\n    *Hint:* You may have to re-manipulate the data into a more usable form.\n\ne.  Based on your calculations so far as well as your visualization, write 1-3 sentences that describe the relationship, in this sample, between age and plans for presidential vote.\n\n# Part 5 - Ethics\n\n## Exercise 10\n\nTo complete this exercise you will first need to watch the documentary Coded Bias.\nTo do so, you either need to be on the Duke network or connected to the Duke VPN. Then go to <https://find.library.duke.edu/catalog/DUKE009834953> and click on \"View Online\".\nOnce you watch the video, write a reflection in 2-5 bullet points highlighting at least one thing that you already knew about (from the course prep materials) and at least one thing you learned from the movie as well as any other aspects of the documentary that you found interesting / enlightening.\n\nReminder about Chat GPT usage.\n\n::: render-commit-push\n<br>\n\nRender, commit, and push one last time.\nMake sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.\n\n<br>\n:::\n",
