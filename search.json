Here, we mutate() the duke_forest data frame to add a new variable called garage which takes the value \"Garage\" if the text string \"Garage\" is detected in the parking variable and takes the test string \"No garage\" if not.\n\n\n\nduke_forest |&gt;\n  mutate(garage = if_else(str_detect(parking, \"Garage\"),   \"Garage\", \"No garage\"))\n\n\nThen, facet by garage and use different colors for the two facets.\nChoose an appropriate binwidth and decide whether a legend is needed, and turn it off if not.\nInclude informative title and axis labels.\nFinally, include a brief (2-3 sentence) narrative comparing the distributions of prices of Duke Forest houses that do and don’t have garages.

    "text": "Part 1\nLet’s take a trip to the Midwest!\nWe will use the midwest data frame for this lab. It is part of the ggplot2 R package, so the midwest data set is automatically loaded when you load the tidyverse package.\nThe data contains demographic characteristics of counties in the Midwest region of the United States.\nBecause the data set is part of the ggplot2 package, you can read documentation for the data set, including variable definitions by typing ?midwest in the Console or searching for midwest in the Help pane.\n\nQuestion 1\nVisualize the distribution of population density of counties using a histogram with geom_histogram() with four separate binwidths: a binwidth of 100, a binwidth of 1,000, a binwidth of 10,000, and a binwidth of 100,000. For example, you can create the first plot with:\n\nggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Population density\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    title = \"Population density of midwesten counties\",\n    subtitle = \"Binwidth = 100\"\n  )\n\nYou will need to make four different histograms. Make sure to set informative titles and axis labels for each of your plots. Then, comment on which binwidth is most appropriate for these data and why.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 1”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nVisualize the distribution of population density of counties again, this time using a boxplot with geom_boxplot(). Make sure to set informative titles and axis labels for your plot. Then, using information as needed from the box plot as well as the histogram from Question 1, describe the distribution of population density of counties and comment on any potential outliers, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative and commenting on whether it makes sense to you that this county is an outlier. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 2”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nCreate a scatterplot of the percentage below poverty (percbelowpoverty on the y-axis) versus percentage of people with a college degree (percollege on the x-axis), where the color and shape of points are determined by state. Make sure to set informative titles, axis, and legend labels for your plot. First, describe the overall relationship between percentage of people with a college degree and percentage below poverty in Midwestern states, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them. Then, comment on whether you can identify how this relationship varies across states.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 3”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\nNow, let’s examine the relationship between the same two variables, once again using different colors and shapes to represent each state, and using a separate plot for each state, i.e., with faceting with facet_wrap(). In addition to points (geom_point()), represent the data with a smooth curve fit to the data with geom_smooth(), with the argument se = FALSE. Make sure to set informative titles, axis, and legend labels for your plot. Which plot do you prefer - this plot or the plot in Question 3? Briefly explain your choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nse = FALSE removes the confidence bands around the line. These bands show the uncertainty around the smooth curve. We’ll discuss uncertainty around estimates later in the course and bring these bands back then.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 4”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\nDo some states have counties that tend to be geographically larger than others?\nTo explore this question, create side-by-side boxplots of area (area) of a county based on state (state). How do typical county area sizes compare across states? How do variabilities of county sizes compare across states? Which state has the single largest county? Identify the name of this county. You can use the data viewer to identify it interactively, you do not have to write code.\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\nOnce again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\nDo some states have a higher percentage of their counties located in a metropolitan area?\nCreate a segmented bar chart with one bar per state and the bar filled with colors according to the value of metro – one color indicating Yes and the other color indicating No for whether a county is considered to be a metro area. The y-axis of the segmented barplot should range from 0 to 1, indicating proportions. Compare the percentage of counties in metro areas across the states based on this plot. Make sure to supplement your narrative with rough estimates of these percentages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nFor this question, you should begin with the data wrangling pipeline below. We will learn more about data wrangling in the coming weeks, so this is a mini-preview. This pipeline creates a new variable called metro based on the value of the existing variable called inmetro. If the value of inmetro is equal to 1 (inmetro == 1), it sets the value of metro to \"Yes\", and if not, it sets the value of metro to \"No\". The resulting data frame is assigned back to midwest, overwriting the existing midwest data frame with a version that includes the new metro variable.\n\nmidwest &lt;- midwest |&gt;\n  mutate(metro = if_else(inmetro == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\n\n\n\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\nAnd once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward. We keep repeating this because it’s important and because we see students forget to do this. So take a moment to make sure you’re following along with the version control instructions.\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\nRecreate the plot below, and then give it a title. Then, identify at least one county that is a clear outlier in Wisconsin (WI) by name. You can use the data viewer to identify them interactively, you do not have to write code. Comment on the population composition of this county by investigating the percentage of other races living there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 reference for themes will be helpful in determining the theme.\nThe size of the points is 2.\nThe transparency (alpha) of the points is 0.5.\nYou can put line breaks in labels with \\n.\n\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your final changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.",

Make sure to set an informative title and axis labels for your plot. Describe the relationship. Was your guess correct?\n\n\nQuestion 9\nNow make a scatter plot of population density (density on the y-axis) vs. land area in meters-squared (land_area_m2 on the x-axis). Make sure to set an informative title and axis labels for your plot. Comment on how this scatterplot compares to the one in Exercise 8 — is the relationship displayed same or different. Explain why.\n\n\nQuestion 10\nDid you select your pages on Gradescope? You don’t need to write an answer for this question, if you select your pages when you upload your lab to Gradescope, you’ll get full points on this question. Otherwise, you’ll get a 0 on this question.2",

There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on ed, the course discussion forum.

My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture and lab sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or Chromebook to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.\nLectures will be recorded and posted on Panopto (link to be shared when available) however lecture attendance is mandatory. The recordings are for catching up with classes you miss due to illness, etc. You will not get the most out of this class if you’re not present and actively participating in it – this is true for lectures and labs.",

    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on five components: application exercises, labs, exams, project, and teamwork.\n\nApplication exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due by the end of the week of the corresponding lecture period (Sunday at midnight). To submit the AEs all you need to do is to push your work to your GitHub repo.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply what you’ve learned in the videos and during lectures to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, lab should be completed and submitted individually. Lab assignments must be typed up using Quarto, all work must be pushed to your GitHub repository for the lab, and the PDF output of the lab must be submitted on Gradescope by the deadline.\nLabs are due at 8 am ET on the indicated due date (generally the Monday after the lab).\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two exams in this course. Each exam will include a closed-notes in-class component and an open-note take-home component. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in videos and reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, and labs.\nMore detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with in teams, and each team will present their work in the last lab session of the semester. The write-up will be due on the same day.\nYou cannot pass this course if you have not completed the project.\nMore information about the project will be provided during the semester.",

    "text": "Five tips for success\nYour success on this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it. The course has been organized so that the burden of learning is on you. Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the lab, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the lab. The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example).\nDon’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nCollaboration: Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nYou may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nFor the project, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\nOn individual assignments you may not directly share work (including code) with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share work (including code) with another team in this class.\n\nOnline resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.\n\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n✅ AI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n❌ AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you.\n\nYou are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a member of the teaching team.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will\n\nautomatically result in a 0 for the assignment,\ncan further impact your overall course grade, and\nwill be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nLabs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for other assessments in the course.\nThere is no late work accepted for exams.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab by the stated due date, you may email the course coordinator, Dr. Mary Knox, before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\n\nCOVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection: Student health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at https://coronavirus.duke.edu. To keep the university community’s safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\nInclement weather: In the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work.  Asynchronous catch-up methods may apply.\nReligious accommodations: Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for syllabus bounty!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’ve read this far in the syllabus, post a picture of your pet if you have one or your favorite meme on ed in this thread!

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.3.2: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nInstall Quarto 1.4: https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here.",

Remember that this data frame is bundled with the ggplot2 package and is automatically loaded when you load the tidyverse package. As a refresher, the data contains demographic characteristics of counties in the Midwest region of the United States. You can read documentation for the data set, including variable definitions by typing ?midwest in the Console or searching for midwest in the Help pane.\n\nQuestion 1\nCalculate the number of counties in each state and display your results in descending order of number of counties. Which state has the highest number of counties, and how many? Which state has the lowest number, and how many?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe number of counties in a state can change over time, so the values you see in this output may not be true today.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 1”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nWhile in a given state two counties can’t have the same name, across states some county names might be shared. A classmate says “Look at that, there is a county called ___ in each state in this dataset!” In a single pipeline, discover all counties that could fill in the blank. Your response should be a data frame with only the county names that could fill in the blank and how many times they appear in the data.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 2”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nReturn to the following box plot of population densities where you were asked to identify at least one outlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this question part, we want you to revisit this box plot and identify the counties described in each part.\na. The counties with a population density higher than 25,000. Your code must use the filter() function.\nb. The county with the highest population density. Your code must use the max() function.\nAnswer using a single data wrangling pipeline for each part. Your response should be a data frame five columns: county name, state name, population density, total population, and area, in this order. If your response has multiple rows, the data frame should be arranged in descending order of population density.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 3”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\nIn Lab 1 you were also asked to describe the distribution of population densities. The following is one acceptable description that touches on shape, center, and spread of this distribution. Calculate the values that should go into the blanks.\n\nThe distribution of population density of counties is unimodal and extremely right-skewed. A typical Midwestern county has population density of ____ people per unit area. The middle 50% of the counties have population densities between ___ to ___ people per unit area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThink about which measures of center and spread are appropriate for skewed distributions.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 4”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\nAnother visualization from Lab 1 was the following that showed the proportion of urban counties in each state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate these proportions in a single data pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember, you’ll first need to create a new variable called metro which takes on the value Yes if the value of inmetro is 1, and No otherwise. You can refer to Lab 1 if you need a refresher on how to do this.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 5”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\nReturn to the following scatter plot of percentage below poverty vs. percentage of people with a college degree, where the color and shape of points are determined by state where you were asked to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. In a single pipeline, identify the observations marked in red squares in the plot above. Your answer should be a data frame with four variables: county, state, percentage below poverty, and percentage college educated.\nb. Create a new variable in midwest called potential_outlier. This variable should take on the value:\n\nYes if the point is one the ones you identified in part a, i.e., one of the points marked in red squares in the plot above.\nNo otherwise.\n\nThen, display the updated midwest data frame, with county, state, percentage below poverty, percentage college educated, potential_outlier as the selected variables, arranged in ascending order of potential_outlier.\nc. Recreate the visualization above, i.e. a scatterplot of percentage below poverty vs. percentage of people with a college degree, however color the points by the newly created potential_outlier variable instead of state.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 6”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\nIn a single pipeline, calculate the total population for each state, and display the results in descending order of total population. Which Midwestern state is most populous? Which is the least populous?\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 7”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\nCalculate the average percentage below poverty for each state and save the resulting data frame as state_poverty with the columns state and mean_percbelowpoverty.\nFirst, display the state_poverty data frame in descending order of mean_percbelowpoverty. Which state has the highest average percentage below poverty across its counties?\nThen, display it in ascending order of mean_percbelowpoverty. Which state has the lowest average percentage below poverty across its counties?\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Question 8”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward."
