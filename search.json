Then, describe what you observe in this plot, making sure to include similarities and differences in the patterns across states.\nNow, let’s examine the relationship between the same two variables, using a separate plot for each state. Label the axes and give the plot a title. Use geom_smooth() with the argument se = FALSE to add a smooth curve fit to the data. Which plot do you prefer - this plot or the plot in Ex 2? Briefly explain your choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nse = FALSE removes the confidence bands around the line. These bands show the uncertainty around the smooth curve. We’ll discuss uncertainty around estimates later in the course and bring these bands back then.\n\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 2”.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward."

The y axis of the segmented barplot should range from 0 to 1, indicating proportions. Describe the distribution of metro across states based on this plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, you should begin with the data wrangling pipeline below. We will learn more about data wrangling in the coming weeks, so this is a mini preview. This pipeline creates a new variable called metro based on the value of the existing variable called inmetro. If the value of inmetro is equal to 1 (inmetro == 1), it sets the value of metro to \"Yes\", and if not, it sets the value of metro to \"No\". The resulting data frame is assigned back to midwest, overwriting the existing midwest data frame with a version that includes the new metro variable.\n\nmidwest &lt;- midwest |&gt;\n  mutate(metro = if_else(inmetro == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\n\n\n\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\nAnd once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.3.2: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nInstall Quarto 1.4: https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here.",

Under this heading you’ll find an entry called Container Manager (CMGR Coursework Containers).\n\nIf the status shows something other than Operational, this means there is a known incident with the containers. Check back later to see if it’s been resolved. If there’s a deadline coming up soon, post on the Ed Discussions to let us know that there’s an issue. We can look into how quickly it might get resolved and decide on what to do about the deadline accordingly. Note: We don’t anticipate this to happen regularly, the systems are Operational a huge majority of the time!\nIf the status shows Operational, this means the system is expected to be working. Check your internet connection, if need be, restart your computer to ensure a fresh new connection. If your issue persists, post on the course forum with details on what you’ve tried and the errors you see (including verbatim errors and/or screenshots).\n\nAnother approach is to request a restart of your container. To do so, select your container as you usually do and then, instead of Login, click on Request Restart. Read the warning in the next page, and then click once more to restart your container.",

My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture and lab sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or Chromebook to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.\nLectures will be recorded and posted on Panopto (link to be shared when available) however lecture attendance is mandatory. The recordings are for catching up with classes you miss due to illness, etc. You will not get the most out of this class if you’re not present and actively participating in it – this is true for lectures and labs.",

    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on five components: application exercises, labs, exams, project, and teamwork.\n\nApplication exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due by the end of the week of the corresponding lecture period (Sunday at midnight). To submit the AEs all you need to do is to push your work to your GitHub repo.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply what you’ve learned in the videos and during lectures to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, lab should be completed and submitted individually. Lab assignments must be typed up using Quarto, all work must be pushed to your GitHub repository for the lab, and the PDF output of the lab must be submitted on Gradescope by the deadline.\nLabs are due at 8 am ET on the indicated due date (generally the Monday after the lab).\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two exams in this course. Each exam will include a closed-notes in-class component and an open-note take-home component. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in videos and reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, and labs.\nMore detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with in teams, and each team will present their work in the last lab session of the semester. The write-up will be due on the same day.\nYou cannot pass this course if you have not completed the project.\nMore information about the project will be provided during the semester.",

    "text": "Five tips for success\nYour success on this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it. The course has been organized so that the burden of learning is on you. Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the lab, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the lab. The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example).\nDon’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nCollaboration: Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nYou may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nFor the project, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\nOn individual assignments you may not directly share work (including code) with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share work (including code) with another team in this class.\n\nOnline resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n✅ AI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n❌ AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you.\n\nYou are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a member of the teaching team.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will\n\nautomatically result in a 0 for the assignment,\ncan further impact your overall course grade, and\nwill be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nLabs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for other assessments in the course.\nThere is no late work accepted for exams.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab by the stated due date, you may email the course coordinator, Dr. Mary Knox, before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\n\nCOVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection: Student health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at https://coronavirus.duke.edu. To keep the university community’s safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\nInclement weather: In the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work.  Asynchronous catch-up methods may apply.\nReligious accommodations: Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for syllabus bounty!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’ve read this far in the syllabus, post a picture of your pet if you have one or your favorite meme on ed in this thread!
